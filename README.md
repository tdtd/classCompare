# classCompare
Pull information from Icy Veins to compare DPS specs

Checks Icy Veins for guides on each DPS spec. Returns info on strengths and weaknesses for classes that have them.
The Client then parses the information to find the most common words (with some exceptions) and generates an array that allows the user to sort by the terms.
